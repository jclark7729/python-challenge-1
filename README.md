Creating an ordering system for food ordering
## The Goal
The goal of this challenge was to create a food ordering system which would demonstrate the student's ability to:
    -create lists
    -create monetary transactional functions
    -use the print command
    -use a loop
    -and probably some other features that I'm forgetting
## The Challenge
For me, the challenges with this "challenge" were many but I decided that failure is the way to go.  My first mistake was to ask too many people for input on the coding, so rather than having a functioning and neat ordering system, I am pretty sure I've ended up with a collage of coding techniques.  My second mistake was not realizing before week 3 that the work we do in class in our break-out sessions should be synced up with my local Visual Studio.  My third and probably biggest mistake was not committing to memory the key words and commands for both Git and Python.  As someone who studied Russian translation for my Bachelors degree, I should know better.  To learn any language, you must first learn the rules, the sentence structure, the syntax, basic language, and once you have mastered that, you should be ready to tackle bigger challenges. So, I consider this third point my biggest failure of this challenge.
## Lessons Learned
    -Before attempting to write any code, learn the commands and some syntax;   commit it to memory by practice, practice, practice
    -Always make sure that Visual Studio is synced up with GitLab to make better use of the break-out sessions in class
    -Sometimes it is not always good to engage multiple people in helping review code, answer questions or make suggestions, as this    lends to an incongruent piece of written code
    -Remember that failure is your friend, and so is a sense of humor
